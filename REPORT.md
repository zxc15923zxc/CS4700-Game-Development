# Project Report

## Overview
This project involved developing core gameplay systems using Unity, including animation handling, UI interaction, inventory mechanics, and general project coordination. Throughout development, several challenges emerged that required iteration, debugging, and design refinement.

## Objectives
- Integrate Animator components with Unity Asset Store assets
- Implement UI interaction between the player, campfire, and environment
- Create a functional and intuitive inventory system
- Manage the project effectively under soft deadlines

## Results
- Setting up Animator components to work correctly with third-party assets required significant adjustments.
- UI interactions needed extensive testing to ensure responsive communication between environmental elements and the player.
- The inventory system required multiple iterations to achieve a stable and user-friendly design.
- Project management demanded flexible planning to balance tasks and soft deadlines.

## Conclusion
The challenges encountered provided insight into animation workflows, UI design, system architecture, and project scheduling. Addressing these obstacles strengthened the overall development process and informed recommendations for future improvements.
